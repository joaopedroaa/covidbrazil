**Juniperus scopulorum**, the Rocky Mountain juniper, is a species of juniper native to western North America, in Canada in British Columbia and southwest Alberta, in the United States from Washington east to North Dakota, south to Arizona and also locally western Texas, and northernmost Mexico from Sonora east to Coahuila.

The name "Joshua tree" is commonly said to have been given by a group of [Mormon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon "Mormon") settlers crossing the Mojave Desert in the mid-19th century: The tree's role in guiding them through the desert combined with its unique shape reminded them of [a biblical story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Ai "Conquest of Ai") in which [Joshua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua "Joshua") keeps his hands reached out for an extended period of time to guide the Israelites in their conquest of Canaan ([Joshua 8:18–26](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Joshua#8:18 "s:Bible (King James)/Joshua")).[\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-jtnp-8)[\[9\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-10) However, no direct or contemporary attestation of this origin exists, and the name Joshua tree is not recorded until after Mormon contact;[\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-jtnp-8)[\[11\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-11) moreover, the physical appearance of the Joshua tree more closely resembles [a similar story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephidim "Rephidim") told of [Moses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses "Moses").[\[12\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-12)

Ranchers and miners who were contemporary with the Mormon immigrants used the trunks and branches as fencing and for fuel for ore-processing steam engines. They referred to these fallen or collapsed Joshua trees as _tevis_ stumps.\[_[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

In addition to the [autonymic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonym_(botany) "Autonym (botany)") [subspecies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies "Subspecies") _Yucca brevifolia_ subsp. _brevifolia_, two other subspecies have been described:[\[13\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-13) _Y. b._ subsp. _jaegeriana_ (the Jaeger Joshua tree or Jaeger's Joshua tree or pygmae yucca) and _Y. b._ subsp. _herbertii_ (Webber's yucca or Herbert Joshua tree), though both are sometimes treated as varieties[\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-ITIS-6)[\[14\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-Grandtner2005-14)[\[15\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-15) or forms.[\[16\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-Egglid2001-16)
